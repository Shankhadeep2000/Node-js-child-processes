# Node-js-child-processes
Created a bash like shell. When the shell is started, it have default working directory set to userâ€™s home directory. The term spawned process refers to the child processes created by the shell.js.

## In this shell, following command work

cd <directory_name> - Should work same as bash shell.
pwd - Prints current working directory.
ls <directory_name> - Should work same as bash shell. Support for flags is not required.
exit - Closes the shell.
